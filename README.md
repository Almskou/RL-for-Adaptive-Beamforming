# RL-for-Adaptive-Beamforming
Master thesis about using reinforcement learning for adaptive beamforming

## Installation guide:
As this project uses [Quadriga](https://quadriga-channel-model.de/) to simulate the environment either Octave or Matlab is needed. Is has then been chosen to use Octave-6.4.0. 

This project will be mainly done in Python 3.8.5, therefore is has been chosen to use **[oct2py](https://pypi.org/project/oct2py/)** version 5.2.0.

### 1. Install oct2py
**oct2py** can be installed using pip
> pip install oct2py

or

> conda install -c conda-forge oct2py

### 2. Install octave
Octave 6.4.0 can be install from:
https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download

### 3. Add **octave-cli** to the variable environment
To use **oct2py** it is needed to add **octave-cli** to the variable environment. This can be done by following **oct2py**'s installation guide:
